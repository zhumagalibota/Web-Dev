    <h1>Lover's Complaint by William Shakespeare</h1>
    <p>
        FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded<br>
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,<br>
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<br>
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;<br>
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br>
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<br>
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<br>
